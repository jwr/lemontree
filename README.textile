h1. Lemontree

Lemontree is a web framework based on the widget tree concept. It is
largely inspired by @Weblocks@ "weblocks":http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/
and borrows many of its concepts.

Lemontree uses the excellent Ring library for underlying HTTP
processing.

h2. Basic assumptions and goals

* Based on the widget tree concept -- applications are composed of
  widgets that may be rendered.

* Actions (rendered as links) modify the widget tree. Updated widgets
  are rendered and sent to the client either as JSON (AJAX) or full-page
  updates.

* Based on the Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI) version 3.

* Most functionality (within reason) degrades gracefully if Javascript
  isn't available.
